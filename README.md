# Chat POC

This chat POC showcases a basic chat component used in two different frontends (organizer & participation).
The repo has been initialized using the vite template "react-ts".

## Start

Run `yarn install` and `yarn dev` locally.
In another window, run `yarn start-chat-server` to execute the mock websocket backend used for the chat messaging.

## Usage

Open `http://localhost:5173/` in the browser to simulate the organizer frontend.
Open `http://localhost:5173/participation` in the browser to simulate the participation frontend.
